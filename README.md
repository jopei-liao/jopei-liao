> We have been documenting lost items exactly where they lie since early 2021—no safekeeping, no returns, and absolutely no lost-and-found desk. Think of it as a digital museum of things people probably wish they still had. We’re here to capture the unexpected, one lonely shoe and misplaced umbrella at a time.😛
